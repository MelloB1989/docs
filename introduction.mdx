## About

Karma is a powerful, modular Go library built to help developers ship faster with less boilerplate. From authentication to API integrations, Karma offers production-ready utilities you can plug in and start using right away. Whether you're bootstrapping a startup or scaling a platform, Karma lets you focus on what matters—your business logic.

No more repetitive setup. No more scattered utilities. Just clean, composable Go code that works.
