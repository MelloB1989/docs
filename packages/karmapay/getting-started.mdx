# Getting Started with KarmaPay Integration

KarmaPay simplifies online payment integrations by providing a unified API to interact with multiple payment gateways such as Razorpay, Stripe, and PhonePe. Follow this guide to set up and start using the KarmaPay package in your Go project.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Redis**
   KarmaPay relies on Redis for managing order states temporarily. Ensure Redis is installed and accessible in your environment.

2. **Self-host KarmaPay PG Service**
   Clone and self-host the [KarmaPay PG Service](https://github.com/MelloB1989/karmapay.pg). This service acts as the backend for managing payment orders. Configure it with proper Redis environment variables.

3. **Environment Variables**
   Set up the required environment variables in your Go project. Here are the variables and their purposes:

   | Environment Variable       | Description                                                                 |
   |----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `KARMAPAY_API_KEY`         | API key encoded in Base64 (prefixed with `kp_`).                            |
   | `KARMAPAY_WEBHOOK`         | The webhook endpoint URL that you configure for payment gateway callbacks. |
   | `KARMAPAY_VERIFY_URL`      | URL used to verify the payment after completion.                            |
   | `KARMAPAY_PG_ENUM`         | The payment gateway you want to use (`RAZORPAY`, `STRIPE`, or `PHONEPE`).   |
   | `KARMAPAY_IDENTIFIER`      | Your project name for identification purposes.                              |
   | `KARMAPAY_APP_DOMAIN`      | Verified domain for the payment gateway (Razorpay, Stripe, or PhonePe).     |
   | `WEBHOOK_SECRET`           | Secret key for validating webhook calls.                                    |
   | `REDIS_URL`                | Redis connection string for managing order states.                         |

   Example `.env` file:

   ```env
   KARMAPAY_API_KEY=kp_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_KEY
   KARMAPAY_WEBHOOK=https://yourdomain.com/webhook
   KARMAPAY_VERIFY_URL=https://yourdomain.com/verify
   KARMAPAY_PG_ENUM=RAZORPAY
   KARMAPAY_IDENTIFIER=YourProjectName
   KARMAPAY_APP_DOMAIN=yourverifieddomain.com
   WEBHOOK_SECRET=YourWebhookSecret
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   ```

## Installation

Install the KarmaPay package in your Go project:

```bash
go get github.com/MelloB1989/karma/payments
```

## Creating a Payment Order

To create a payment order, use the `payments.CreatePaymentOrder()` function. This function generates a dynamic payment URL that redirects users to the payment gateway.

### Parameters

The `payments.CreatePaymentOrder()` function accepts the following fields:

- **OrderAmount** (`int32`): Total amount for the payment.
- **OrderCurrency** (`string`): Currency code (e.g., `INR`).
- **OrderDescription** (`string`): Description of the order or purpose of payment.
- **OrderMode** (`string`): The payment gateway enum (`RAZORPAY`, `STRIPE`, `PHONEPE`) set in your environment variables.
- **WebhookURL** (`string`): The webhook URL to handle payment gateway callbacks.
- **RedirectURL** (`string`): A URL where users are redirected post-payment (optional).
- **Registration** (`string`): Set to `"no"` if registration is not required.

### Example Code

Here’s how you can create a payment order in your Go application:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/MelloB1989/karma/payments"
	"github.com/MelloB1989/karma/config"
)

func createOrder() {
	// Define the order parameters
	order := payments.CreatePaymentOrder{
		OrderAmount:      int32(1000),                        // Amount in minor units (e.g., 1000 for ₹10)
		OrderCurrency:    "INR",                              // Payment currency
		OrderDescription: "Booking for venue",               // Description for the payment
		OrderMode:        config.DefaultConfig().KARMAPAY_PG_ENUM, // Your payment gateway enum from env
		WebhookURL:       fmt.Sprintf("%s?uid=%s", config.DefaultConfig().KARMAPAY_WEBHOOK, "unique-user-id"), // Dynamic webhook URL
		RedirectURL:      "",                                // Optional redirect URL
		Registration:     "no",                              // Registration not required
	}

	// Call the CreatePaymentOrder function
	paymentURL, err := payments.CreatePaymentOrder(order)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating order:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Payment URL:", paymentURL)
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Payment**
   Once the payment is completed, use the `payments.VerifyPayment()` function to validate the transaction.

2. **Handle Webhooks**
   Implement the webhook handler in your project to process real-time payment notifications from the payment gateway.

3. **Explore More**
   Refer to the [KarmaPay GitHub repository](https://github.com/MelloB1989/karma) for advanced usage and additional configurations.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check:

- Redis connectivity (`REDIS_URL`).
- Proper configuration of environment variables.
- Correct hosting of the [KarmaPay PG Service](https://github.com/MelloB1989/karmapay.pg).
- Gateway-specific requirements (e.g., domain verification).
