# Setting Up the Payment Verification Endpoint

The `payments.VerifyPaymentAPI()` function from the **KarmaGo** package simplifies payment verification by returning a handler function that integrates seamlessly with the [GoFiber](https://gofiber.io) framework. This endpoint is essential for validating payments after they are completed.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the verification endpoint, ensure:

1. **Environment Variables are Properly Configured**
   Set the `KARMAPAY_VERIFY_URL` in your `.env` file to the endpoint where you’ll handle payment verification. For example:

   ```env
   KARMAPAY_VERIFY_URL=https://yourdomain.com/payments/verify
   ```

2. **GoFiber Installed**
   If GoFiber is not already installed in your project, add it using:

   ```bash
   go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
   ```

3. **KarmaPay PG Service is Running**
   Ensure the KarmaPay PG Service is up and running with the correct environment variables.

## Creating the Verification Endpoint

The `payments.VerifyPaymentAPI()` function provides a Fiber handler that validates the payment details. You just need to register it to your Fiber application.

### Example Code

Here’s how you can set up the verification endpoint:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
	"github.com/MelloB1989/karma/payments"
)

func main() {
	// Initialize Fiber app
	app := fiber.New()

	// Define the payment verification route
	app.Post("/payments/verify", payments.VerifyPaymentAPI())

	// Start the server
	if err := app.Listen(":3000"); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Route Handling**
   The route `/payments/verify` listens for POST requests. This should be the URL you set in the `KARMAPAY_VERIFY_URL` environment variable.

2. **Verification Logic**
   - The `payments.VerifyPaymentAPI()` function handles the logic for validating the payment.
   - It ensures that the payment details match those stored temporarily in Redis (via the KarmaPay PG Service).
   - The function also checks the payment status with the respective payment gateway.

3. **Environment Variable Linking**
   The `KARMAPAY_VERIFY_URL` variable connects your Go application to the KarmaPay service, ensuring the verification endpoint is properly registered.

---

## Example `.env` File

Make sure your `.env` file includes the correct URL for verification:

```env
KARMAPAY_VERIFY_URL=https://yourdomain.com/payments/verify
```

---

## Testing the Verification Endpoint

1. **Simulate a Payment**
   Use the `CreatePaymentOrder` function to generate a payment URL and complete a transaction.

2. **Webhook Callback**
   The payment gateway triggers the verification endpoint upon successful payment. Ensure the endpoint is reachable and correctly configured.

3. **Verify the Results**
   Check the response from the verification API to confirm the payment is valid.

---

## Notes for Beginners

- The `VerifyPaymentAPI()` function is plug-and-play. You don’t need to write additional code to handle the verification logic unless you have custom requirements.
- Ensure that your `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is properly set and matches the configuration in your payment gateway to validate webhook authenticity.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Payment State:** Ensure Redis is accessible and properly configured.
- **Incorrect URL:** Verify the `KARMAPAY_VERIFY_URL` is correct and points to your verification route.
- **Webhook Not Triggering:** Double-check your payment gateway settings and webhook configuration.

By following this guide, you’ll have a fully functional payment verification endpoint integrated into your GoFiber application. This ensures smooth and secure validation of all transactions handled by KarmaPay.
