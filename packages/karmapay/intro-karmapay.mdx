# Introducing KarmaPay Integration in KarmaGo

We’re excited to announce a major update for **KarmaPay**! To streamline development and enhance the capabilities of our tools, **KarmaPay** is now integrated into the **KarmaGo** package. This change reflects our commitment to providing developers with a unified, powerful, and modular library to simplify Go development.

## Why the Change?

Incorporating KarmaPay into KarmaGo aligns with our vision of reducing complexity and enabling developers to focus on their core application logic. Here’s why we made this switch:

1. **Unified Development Experience**
   By merging KarmaPay with KarmaGo, developers can now access payment gateway integration alongside other essential utilities, all within a single library. No more managing separate microservices, APIs, or databases for payments.

2. **Simplified Integration**
   KarmaPay, as part of KarmaGo, is designed to make payment gateway integration seamless. Whether you’re using Razorpay, Stripe, PhonePe, or other gateways, you can now configure and manage payments with less effort.

3. **Enhanced Modularity**
   The KarmaGo package is built with modularity in mind. You can leverage KarmaPay’s features alongside utilities for authentication, SQL parsing, middleware, file management, and more, all from one place.

4. **Optimized Maintenance**
   Maintaining a separate microservice for payments required additional resources and infrastructure. By integrating KarmaPay into KarmaGo, we’ve reduced redundancy and centralized the codebase, making updates and maintenance more efficient.

## What Does KarmaPay in KarmaGo Offer?

KarmaPay, now a module within KarmaGo, retains all its powerful features while becoming easier to use and more integrated into your workflow:

- **Support for Multiple Payment Gateways**
   Effortlessly work with Razorpay, Stripe, PhonePe, and more (additional gateways to be added soon).

- **Unified API**
   A consistent API interface that abstracts the complexities of different payment gateways.

- **Global Transactions**
   Seamless support for multiple currencies and payment methods.

- **Flexibility and Customization**
   Configure payment gateways to suit your needs without additional setup.

- **Security and Scalability**
   Industry-best security practices combined with scalable design to handle high transaction volumes.

## How to Get Started?

If you're already using **KarmaGo**, update to the latest version to access KarmaPay. For new users, simply include KarmaGo in your project, and you’ll have everything you need to get started with payment integration and more.

## A Unified Path Forward

This change represents our ongoing effort to simplify and enhance the developer experience. By merging KarmaPay into KarmaGo, we’re giving you a comprehensive toolkit for building modern, scalable applications in Go.

We’re excited for you to explore this new integration and look forward to your feedback!
