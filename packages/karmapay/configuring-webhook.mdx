# Setting Up the Webhook Endpoint

The **KarmaGo** package provides a simple way to handle payment gateway webhooks securely and efficiently. The `payments.KarmaPayWebhook()` function integrates with GoFiber to validate incoming webhook requests and execute a custom action function when the webhook is verified.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the webhook endpoint, ensure:

1. **Environment Variables are Properly Configured**
   Set the `KARMAPAY_WEBHOOK` variable in your `.env` file. For example:

   ```env
   KARMAPAY_WEBHOOK=https://yourdomain.com/webhook
   ```

2. **Webhook Secret**
   The `WEBHOOK_SECRET` variable must be configured in your environment for secure webhook validation. For example:

   ```env
   WEBHOOK_SECRET=my-secure-webhook-secret
   ```

3. **Webhook URL Registered with Payment Gateway**
   Ensure that the `KARMAPAY_WEBHOOK` URL is registered with the payment gateway you're using (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe, etc.).

## Creating the Webhook Endpoint

The `payments.KarmaPayWebhook()` function takes a custom action function as input. This action function is executed when the webhook is verified successfully.

### Example Code

Here’s how to set up the webhook endpoint in your Go application:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
	"github.com/MelloB1989/karma/payments"
	"yourproject/bookings"
)

// Define the action function for handling webhook data
func WebhookHandler(data map[string]string) error {
	uid := data["uid"]
	bookingId := data["koid"]

	// Retrieve the booking by ID and user ID
	booking, err := bookings.GetBookingByIdAndUID(bookingId, uid)
	if err != nil || booking == nil {
		return err
	}

	// Update the booking status
	booking.Status = "CONFIRMED"
	err = bookings.UpdateBooking(booking)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return nil
}

func main() {
	// Initialize Fiber app
	app := fiber.New()

	// Define the webhook route
	app.Post("/webhook", payments.KarmaPayWebhook(WebhookHandler))

	// Start the server
	if err := app.Listen(":3000"); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Webhook Route Handling**
   - The `/webhook` route listens for POST requests from the payment gateway.
   - This should match the URL you set in the `KARMAPAY_WEBHOOK` environment variable.

2. **Verification and Execution**
   - The `KarmaPayWebhook()` function validates the incoming webhook request using the `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
   - If the request is verified successfully, the custom action function (`WebhookHandler` in this example) is executed.

3. **Automatic Parameters**
   - The webhook payload automatically includes a `koid` field (the Order ID) added by the KarmaPay service.
   - You can use `koid` to retrieve the relevant booking or order.

4. **Custom Action Function**
   - The `WebhookHandler` function takes a `map[string]string` containing the webhook data.
   - You can define custom logic, such as updating booking statuses or triggering other workflows, based on the webhook data.

## Example `.env` File

Here’s an example `.env` configuration for the webhook:

```env
KARMAPAY_WEBHOOK=https://yourdomain.com/webhook
WEBHOOK_SECRET=my-secure-webhook-secret
```

---

## Testing the Webhook

1. **Simulate a Payment**
   Use the `CreatePaymentOrder` function to generate a payment URL and complete a transaction.

2. **Trigger the Webhook**
   The payment gateway sends a POST request to the `/webhook` endpoint after the payment is completed.

3. **Verify the Results**
   Check that the `WebhookHandler` function executes correctly and performs the desired action (e.g., updating the booking status).

---

## Notes for Beginners

- **Webhook Verification:** The `KarmaPayWebhook` function automatically verifies the webhook signature using `WEBHOOK_SECRET`. You don’t need to write custom verification logic.
- **Action Function Flexibility:** The action function can perform any custom operation you define, as long as it matches the signature `func(data map[string]string) error`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Webhook Not Triggering:** Ensure the payment gateway has the correct URL and is configured to send webhook events.
- **Signature Mismatch:** Verify that `WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches the secret configured in the payment gateway.
- **Action Function Errors:** Check the logs for errors in the custom action function.

With this setup, your application will be able to handle and process webhook events from KarmaPay securely and efficiently.
